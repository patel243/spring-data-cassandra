== Exception Translation

The Spring Framework provides exception translation for a wide variety of database and mapping technologies.
This has traditionally been for JDBC and JPA. Spring Data for Apache Cassandra extends this feature to Apache Cassandra by providing an implementation of the `org.springframework.dao.support.PersistenceExceptionTranslator` interface.

The motivation behind mapping to Spring's {spring-framework-docs}html/dao.html#dao-exceptions[consistent data access exception hierarchy]
is to let you write portable and descriptive exception handling code without resorting to coding against and handling specific Cassandra exceptions.
All of Spring's data access exceptions are inherited from the
`DataAccessException` class, so you can be sure that you can catch all database-related exceptions within a single try-catch block.
